# Plaiground

Welcome to the plaiground project! In this directory, you'll find the files you need to be able to express/test ideas using the [araignee](https://github.com/brupla6126/araignee), [artemisia](https://github.com/brupla6126/artemisia), [caiman](https://github.com/brupla6126/caiman) gems and the [gamia](https://github.com/brupla6126/gamia), [simia](https://github.com/brupla6126/simia) applications. Put your Ruby code in the file `lib/plaiground`. To experiment with that code, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt.

## Installation
Plaiground comes within the maia repo.

## Usage

Just express your ideas, proof of concept int this project. Not mandatory to write tests but ensure to have easily readable code.

## Development

After checking out the maia repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
